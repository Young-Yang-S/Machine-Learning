## [Reverse scooping ](https://simplystatistics.org/2011/12/03/reverse-scooping/)<br>
From authors in simplystats, thanks for their good ideas<br>
Reverse scooping is when someone publishes your idea after you, and doesnâ€™t cite you. One thing author has learned is that if you want to claim an idea, try to include it in the title or abstract as very few papers get read cover-to-cover.
