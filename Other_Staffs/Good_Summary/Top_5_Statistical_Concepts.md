 Quoted: Just for fun, I made up my list of the top 5 most critical skills for a statistician by my own definition. They are by necessity very general (I only gave myself 5).<br> 
1. __The ability to manipulate/organize/work with data on computers__ - whether it is with excel, R, SAS, or Stata, to be a statistician you have to be able to work with data. 
2. __A knowledge of exploratory data analysis__- how to make plots, how to discover patterns with visualizations, how to explore assumptions
3. __Scientific/contextual knowledge__ - at least enough to be able to abstract and formulate problems. This is what separates statisticians from mathematicians. 
4. __Skills to distinguish true from false patterns__ - whether with p-values, posterior probabilities, meaningful summary statistics, cross-validation or any other means. 
5. __The ability to communicate results to people without math skills__ - a key component of being a statistician is knowing how to explain math/plots/analyses.
