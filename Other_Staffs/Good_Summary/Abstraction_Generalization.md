## [Thinking about Abstraction and Generalization](https://simplystatistics.org/2012/08/06/in-which-brian-debates-abstraction-with-t-bone/)

Simplystats professor definitions:

__Abstraction__ - reducing a technique, idea or concept to its essence or core.

__Generalization__ -  extending a technique, idea or concept to areas for which it was not originally intended.

__PhD__ - a post baccalaureate degree  that requires substantial new contributions to knowledge.

The term “substantial new contributions” in my definition of a PhD is admittedly fuzzy. To tie it down, examples that I think do create new knowledge in the field of statistics include:

- applying existing techniques to data where they have not been used before (generalization of the application of the techniques),
- developing statistical software (abstraction of statistical and mathematical thoughts into code),
- developing new statistical methods from existing ones (generalization),
- proving new theory (both abstraction and generalization) and
- creating new data analysis pipelines (both abstraction and generalization).

Abstraction and generalization facilitates learning new areas. Knowledge of the abstract core of a discipline makes that knowledge much more portable. This is seen across every discipline. Musicians who know music theory can use their knowledge for any instrument;  computer scientists who understand data structures and algorithms can switch languages easily; electrical engineers who understand signal processing can switch between technologies easily. Abstraction is what allows them to see past the concrete (instrument, syntax, technology) to the essence (music, algorithm, signal).
