From [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html)<br>
There are great __startup ideas__ lying around unexploited right __under our noses__. One reason we don't see them is a phenomenon I call schlep blindness. Schlep means a tedious, unpleasant task.

Schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty much what business consists of. A company is defined by the schleps it will undertake. And schleps should be dealt with the same way you'd deal with a cold swimming pool: __just jump in__. Which is not to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that __you should never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great.__

The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much of it is unconscious. Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps. That's __schlep blindness__.

The phenomenon isn't limited to startups. Most people don't consciously decide to be in as good physical shape as Olympic athletes, for example. Their unconscious mind decides for them, shrinking from the work involved.

The most striking example I know of schlep blindness is Stripe, or rather Stripe's idea. For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was. Thousands of people must have known about this problem. And yet when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or aggregators for local events. Why? Why work on problems few care much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the most important components of the world's infrastructure? Because schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea of fixing payments.

Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe site began by asking "should we fix payments, or build a recipe site?" and chose the recipe site. __Though the idea of fixing payments was right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved.__ 

How do you overcome schlep blindness? Frankly, __the most valuable antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance__. Most successful founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome, they might never have started it. Maybe that's one reason the most successful startups of all so often have young founders.

In practice the founders grow with the problems. But no one seems able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders. So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make two mistakes that cancel each other out. They don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to. Older founders only make the first mistake.

Ignorance can't solve everything though. Some ideas so obviously entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them. How do you see ideas like that? The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of the picture. Instead of asking "what problem should I solve?" ask "what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?" If someone who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that, Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.

It's too late now to be Stripe, but there's plenty still broken in the world, if you know how to see it.

Above all, schlep blindness is something that is tedious to do or difficult to achieve, then we unconsiously ignore it. But such kind of seemingly tedious task would bring with good result or interesting outcome for us. Like Stripe, like you should have a good body like athletics. We should try to realize its importance and put it into the same level of insightful ideas.
