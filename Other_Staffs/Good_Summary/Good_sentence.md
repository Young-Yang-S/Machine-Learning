1. Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. -Geroge Box
2. Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way -Leo Tolstoy
3. Whenever we are curious, confused or in doubt, we run the test and let the data speak for itself. -Mike Wolf
4. As with gold or oil, data has no intrinsic value. Big science, which bridges the gap between knowledge and insight, is where the real value is. Gold requires mining and processing before it finds its way into our jewelry, electronics and etc. Oil requires extraction and refinement before it becomes the gasoline that fuels our vehicles. Likewise, data requires collection, mining and, finally, analysis before we can realize its true value for businesses, governments, and individuals alike.The big science.is that magic ingredient of algorithms and advanced mathematics that bridges the gap between knowledge and insight. It is where the value is. It is the future. -Alex Yoder
