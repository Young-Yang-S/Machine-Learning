# How to getting email responses from busy people
[(https://simplystatistics.org/2011/09/23/getting-email-responses-from-busy-people/)]
## Quick Tricks: The SI Rules
- Try to send no more than one email a day. 
- Emails should be 3 sentences or less. Better if you can get the whole email in the subject line. 
- If you need information, ask yes or no questions whenever possible. Never ask a question that requires a full sentence response.-
- When something is time sensitive, state the action you will take if you don’t get a response by a time you specify. 
- Be as specific as you can while conforming to the length requirements. 
- Bonus: include obvious keywords people can use to search for your email. 


### Example 1

Subject: Is my response to reviewer 2 ok with you?
Body: I’ve attached the paper/responses to referees.

### Example 2
Subject: Can you send my letter of recommendation to john.doe@someplace.com?
Body: Keywords = recommendation, Jeff, John Doe.

### Example 3
Subject: I revised the draft to include your suggestions about simulations and language
Body: Revisions attached. Let me know if you have any problems, otherwise I’ll submit Monday at 2pm.
