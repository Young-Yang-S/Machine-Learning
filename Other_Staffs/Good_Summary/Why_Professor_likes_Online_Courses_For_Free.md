# [Ideas from SimplyStats about ONLINE FREE COURSES](https://simplystatistics.org/2012/08/10/why-we-are-teaching-massive-open-online-courses-moocs/)
The reason why they like to share courese online freely
- Open Access. This is an opportunity to reach a broad and diverse audience. As academics devoted to open science, we also think that opening up our courses to the biggest possible audience is, in principle, a good thing. 
- Excitement about statistics. The data revolution means that there is a really intense interest in statistics right now. 
- We work hard to develop good materials. We put effort into building materials that our students will find useful. We want to maximize the impact of these efforts. 
- It is an exciting experiment. Online teaching, including very very good online teaching, has been around for a long time. But the model of free courses at incredibly large scale is actually really new. Whether you think it is a gimmick or something here to stay, it is exciting to be part of the first experimental efforts to build courses at scale.
- Good advertising. Every professor at a research school is a start-up of one. One way to bloom  that is writing good research papers, another is having awesome students, a third is giving talks at statistical and scientific conferences. This is an amazing new opportunity to showcase the cool things that we are doing. 
- Coursera built some cool toys. As statisticians, we love new types of data. It’s like candy. Coursera has all sorts of cool toys for collecting data about drop out rates, participation, discussion board answers, peer review of assignments, etc. We are pretty psyched to take these out for a spin and see how we can use them to improve our teaching.
- Innovation is going to happen in education. Education has been done the same way for hundreds (or thousands) of years. As new educational technologies develop, we’d rather be on the front lines figuring out the best new model than fighting to hold on to the old model.
