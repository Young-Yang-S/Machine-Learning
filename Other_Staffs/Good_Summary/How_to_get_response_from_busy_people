The SI Rules

Try to send no more than one email a day. 
Emails should be 3 sentences or less. Better if you can get the whole email in the subject line. 
If you need information, ask yes or no questions whenever possible. Never ask a question that requires a full sentence response.
When something is time sensitive, state the action you will take if you donâ€™t get a response by a time you specify. 
Be as specific as you can while conforming to the length requirements. 
Bonus: include obvious keywords people can use to search for your email.
