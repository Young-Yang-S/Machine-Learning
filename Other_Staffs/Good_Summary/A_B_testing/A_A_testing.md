**A/A Testing**<br>

***What Is A/A Testing?***<br>
A/A testing is the tactic of using A/B testing to test two __identical versions__ of a page against each other. Typically, this is done to check that the tool being used to run the experiment is __statistically fair__. In an A/A test, the tool should report no difference in conversions between the control and variation, if the test is implemented correctly.<br>

***Why Is A/A Testing Important?***<br>
Why would you want to run a test where the variation and original are identical?<br>

1. Determine the baseline conversion: In some cases, you might want to use this to monitor the number of conversions on the page where you are running the A/A test to track the number of conversions and determine the baseline conversion rate before beginning an A/B or multivariate test.<br>

2. Double-checking the effectiveness and accuracy of the A/B testing software. You should look to see if the software reports that there is a statistically significant (>95% statistical significance) difference between the control and variation. If the software reports that there is a statistically significant difference, that’s a problem, and you’ll want to check that the software is correctly implemented on your website or mobile app.<br>

***Things To Keep In Mind With A/A Testing***<br>
- When running an A/A test, it’s important to keep in mind that finding a difference in conversion rate between identical test and control pages is always a possibility. This isn’t necessarily a poor reflection on the A/B testing platform, as there is always an element of randomness when it comes to testing.<br>

- When running any A/B test, keep in mind that the statistical significance of your results is a probability, not a certainty. Even a statistical significance level of 95% represents a 1 in 20 chance that the results you’re seeing are due to random chance. In most cases, your A/A test should report that the conversion improvement between the control and variation is statistically inconclusive—because the underlying truth is that there isn’t one to find.
