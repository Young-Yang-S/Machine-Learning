**A/B/N Testing**<br>

***What Is A/B/n Testing?***<br>
A/B/n testing is a type of website testing where __multiple versions of a web page are compared against each other to determine which has the highest conversion rate__. In this type of test, __traffic is split randomly and evenly distributed between the different versions of the page to determine which variation performs the best__.<br>

A/B/n testing is an __extension of A/B testing__, in which two versions of a page (a version A and version B) are tested against each other. However, with an A/B/n test, more than two versions of a page are compared against each other at once. “N” refers to the number of versions being tested, anywhere from two versions to the “nth” version.<br>

A/B/n testing can also be contrasted with what’s known as __multivariate testing__. A multivariate test also compares multiple versions of a page at once, by testing all possible combinations of variations at once. __Multivariate testing is more comprehensive than A/B/n testing and is used to test changes to specific elements on a page whereas A/B/n testing can be used to test completely different versions of a page against each other__.<br>

***Why is A/B/n testing important?***<br>
A/B/n testing helps you understand which website design helps you generate the most engagement and conversions from your users. You can test multiple pages against each other at once and use data to determine which variation you should go with.<br>

For instance, when a company has more than one competing ideas for what the best website layout would be, A/B/n testing can be used to test each idea and render a decision based on concrete data that shows how one version outperformed others.<br>

In addition to helping which version of a page is most successful, A/B/n testing also shows which version of a page performed the __worst__. By analyzing these low performing pages, it is possible to come up with hypotheses for why certain features convert better than others, and these lessons can then be incorporated into new tests on other pages of the site.<br>


***Potential Downsides Of A/B/n Testing***<br>
Testing too many variations (when one can't be decided upon) can further divide traffic to the website among many variations. This can increase the amount of time and traffic required to reach statistically significant result and create what some might call “statistical noise” in the process.<br>

Another consideration to be mindful of when running multiple A/B/n tests is to not lose sight of the bigger picture. Just because different variables performed the best in their own experiments, it doesn’t always mean those variables would work well combined. Consider running multivariate tests to test all variations and make sure that improvements to top level metrics carry all the way through the conversion funnel.
