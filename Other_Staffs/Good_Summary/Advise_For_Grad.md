What are the top 3 skills you look for in a student who works with you?

I look for a student who is intellectually curious, self-motivated, and a good personality fit. Intellectual curiosity is a prerequisite for grad school, self-motivation is needed to make it through the 2 years of PhD level coursework and 3 years of research that make up a typical Stat/Biostat PhD, and a good personality fit is needed because grad school is long and sometimes frustrating ( but ultimately very rewarding), and itâ€™s important to have an advisor who can be a friend along the way!
