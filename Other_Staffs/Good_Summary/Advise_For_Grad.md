### What are the top 3 skills you look for in a student who works with you?
From [Daniela(Assistant professor of Biostatistics at the University of Washington in Seattle)](https://simplystatistics.org/2011/10/14/interview-with-daniela-witten/)

I look for a student who is intellectually curious, self-motivated, and a good personality fit.
- Intellectual curiosity is a prerequisite for grad school
- Self-motivation is needed to make it through the 2 years of PhD level coursework and 3 years of research that make up a typical Stat/Biostat PhD,
- Good personality fit is needed because grad school is long and sometimes frustrating ( but ultimately very rewarding)
