__Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher__ (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962) was a British statistician, geneticist, and professor. For his work in statistics, he has been described as "__a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science__" and "__the single most important figure in 20th century statistics++__". In genetics, his work used mathematics to combine Mendelian genetics and natural selection; this contributed to the revival of Darwinism in the early 20th-century revision of the theory of evolution known as the modern synthesis. For his contributions to biology, Fisher has been called "__the greatest of Darwin’s successors__".<br>

Fisher held strong views on race, insisting on racial differences. (This is too awful)<br>

He is known as __one of the three principal founders of population genetics__. He outlined __Fisher's principle__, __the Fisherian runaway__ and __sexy son hypothesis theories of sexual selection__. His contributions to __statistics__ include promoting the __method of maximum likelihood__ and deriving the __properties of maximum likelihood estimators__, __fiducial inference__, __the derivation of various sampling distributions__, founding __principles of the design of experiments__, and __much more__.[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher)<br>

But interestingly authors in [simplystats](https://simplystatistics.org/2012/03/07/r-a-fisher-is-the-most-influential-scientist-ever/) found thant R.A. Fisher, (many of the concepts he developed are so common and are considered so standard)  is never cited/credited. Here are some examples of things he invented along with a conservative number of citations they would have received calculated via Google Scholar*. (From simplystatistics)<br>
1. P-values - 3 million citations
2. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) - 1.57 million citations
3. Maximum likelihood estimation - 1.54 million citations
4. Fisher’s linear discriminant 62,400 citations
5. Randomization/permutation tests 37,940 citations
