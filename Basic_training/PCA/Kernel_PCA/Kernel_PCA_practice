This practice is a simple but good examples to show how powerful the kernel PCA is. In this file, we have two examples, moon-like and concentric circle samples. We can see 
from this practice that: traditional PCA can not help to transfer non linear data into linear data after dimension reduction. But proper Kernel PCA could help me to achieve 
this goal. Thus when we process our data set, we should try to use kernel pca to deal with the problems of non linearity.

# Tip: This example is from greedyai company for studying. Thanks for your kind help.
