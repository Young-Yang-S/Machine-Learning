This folder contains one algorithm that are created by Ji Zhu and Trevor Hastie. They introduced the kernel to the LR models which has two main contributions. The first one
is to output the probability of classifications directly because of using logistic model, whereas the SVM needs to use logisitic function to convert the output of SVM to the 
probability. And because they use LR model, it is natural to extend it to multi classification task, while SVM needs to use ovr or ovo methods to extend. Secondly, they also 
introduce import vectors (much smaller size than support vectors) to shorten the learning time. After all, it has advantages on probability output, computational time and 
mutiple classification task compared with SVM.
